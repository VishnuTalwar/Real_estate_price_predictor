This is a data science project, this website predicts real-estate prices. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using the Bangalore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. The second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests. The third component is the website built in HTML, CSS, and javascript that allows users to enter the home square ft area, bedrooms, etc and it will call the python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. Technology and tools which is used
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5.Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for HTTP server
7.HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
